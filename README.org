This repository contains my configuration files for managing multiple NixOS systems, including desktops, laptops, and a server. The configuration is structured to support modularity, allowing anyone to start with these configs and selectively enable the modules they need for their own homeserver setup.

* Goals
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a flexible and modular configuration for:
- Desktop systems running Hyprland, Waybar, Doom Emacs, and other key tools
- A server hosting various services accessible through a secure setup with Keycloak authentication

* Structure
The repository is organized into separate configuration files for each machine, with reusable modules for common services and setups.
- /hm-modules/ contains configurations for specific tools I use on my machine.
- /modules/ contains thematic packages like in /programming.nix/ as well as my /hyprland/ config.
- /hosts/ contains machine specific information. It is the place where you would put your /hardware-configuration.nix/
** modules
- [[file:modules/services.nix::{][services.nix]] contains the desktop services I want to have running for all users (not managed by home-manager)

* Desktop Software
| Software   | Purpose                             |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Hyprland   | Window manager                      |
| Waybar     | Status bar                          |
| Doom Emacs | Code editor and personal organizer  |
| Kitty      | Terminal emulator                   |
| Nushell    | Modern shell                        |
| Swaylock   | Screen locker                       |
* Desktop config
2 main files drive the desktop configuration: [[file:hosts/desktop/common.nix::{][common.nix]], which contains the commmon configuration for my desktop systems like user setup, filesystems and hardware config like bluetooth and network.
[[file:modules/desktop.nix::{][desktop.nix]] is the entrance file for all packages and services running on my desktop systems.
* Server Setup
The server configuration, found in `[[file:hosts/server/alucard.nix::{][alucard.nix]]`, is designed to create a home server environment with the following services, all routed through nginx reverse proxies and accessible via Dashy, an entry point dashboard:

| Service      | Description                  |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Dashy        | Homepage and service portal  |
| Jellyfin     | Media server                 |
| Paperless    | Document management          |
| Navidrome    | Music server                 |
| Calibre-Web  | E-book library               |
| Overleaf     | Collaborative document editor|
| Coder        | Code-server for development  |

All access to these services is managed via Keycloak for unified authentication.

* How to Use
To get started, clone this repository and review the [[file:hosts/server/alucard.nix::{][alucard.nix]] configuration file and other system-specific files for module options. Each module can be selectively enabled depending on the services you want to deploy on your own system.
** Secret Management
To manage secrets on my system and the server, I utilize [[https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix][sops-nix]], which is managed via the configuration files [[file:.sops.yaml::keys:][.sops.yaml]], [[file:secrets/secrets.nix::{][secrets.nix]] and the secrets file [[file:secrets/dmbs.yaml::keycloak:][dmbs.yaml]] for the server.

* Future Goals
I aim to continuously improve the modularity of these configurations, adding more reusable modules and further simplifying the setup process for both desktop and server configurations.
